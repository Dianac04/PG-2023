Analysis and Segmentation of Hotel Reviews in 11 Towns Located in Santander, Colombia

The code that enables me to conduct this analysis is organized as follows:

A. Data Extraction: This code is used for scraping the TripAdvisor website to collect all the necessary reviews needed to create a comprehensive database.

B. Polarity Analysis: This code analyzes the polarity of the text found in the database, identifying whether the sentiment expressed is positive, negative, or neutral.

C. Sentiment Analysis: I used a pre-trained model from Hugging Face with minimal modifications to detect the primary emotion present in each review. This allows for a comparison with the results from the polarity analysis to ensure that the findings are valid and consistent with reality.

D. Category Classification: This code classifies the reviews into specific categories based on criteria established by the UNWTO (United Nations World Tourism Organization).

Once each of these codes is implemented step by step, itâ€™s important to consider that the code was created in October 2023. Changes to the conditions and configurations may be necessary due to potential updates to the websites, changes in cybersecurity policies, or personal data protection regulations.
